## The Stand with Guihulngan Manifesto of Unity





We are STAND WITH GUIHULNGAN, a unity of different sectoral organizations, formations and individuals against the continuing and widespread fascism in the form of militarization in the countryside, extrajudicial killings, threats on lives and offensives against leaders and members of progressive organizations and the civilian populace in the localities using trumped-up cases filed in court, propagation by state agents of lies and deception in order to generate a condition of terror and fear to be used as basis for the declaration of nationwide martial law that is a means to extend Duterte’s power.

We condemn the brutal and gross attacks against the people of Negros Oriental particularly in Guihulngan City through the Sychronized Enhanced Managing of Police Operations (SEMPO or Oplan Sauron). After integrating with the victims and further knowledge of the events and evidences, we determine SEMPO as a tokhang-style tactic and method employing the court, forces from the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Local Government Unit (LGU) in a plot to kill, illegally arrest and spread fear among civilians wherein the so-called principal aim was to destroy the revolutionary movement but the progressive personalities, organizations and civilians became the targets instead. In truth, SEMPO is a measure to ensure the control of Duterte’s clique of the course and result of the upcoming May 2019 elections that indicates an obvious intervention and violation of the Filipino people’s democratic right to vote the candidate that truly upholds the interest of the exploited and oppressed.

We call for justice for the SEMPO victims. Seven were brutally murdered, almost 50 were illegally arrested and accused of illegally possessing firearms, 56 houses were ransacked wherein money, housewares and appliances were stolen and crops were damaged, almost 200 families comprised of a thousand individuals including women and children evacuated from eight affected barangays in Guihulngan City, Canlaon City of Negros Oriental and Moises Padilla of Negros Occidental. The affected individuals and families were dislocated from their homes and livelihood.

We assert the termination of military operations in the countrysides and the withdrawal of the presence of the 94th Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army and other special forces of the PNP in Guihulngan City. We stand united against fascism not only in Guihulngan City but also in the whole country under the Duterte regime.

We must not be deceived by the lies, twisted information and made-up scenarios to aggravate the fear and terror in the communities and justify the intensifying presence of the military and police. It is but right to expose to the public what really happened in Guihulngan City and other parts of Negros Oriental under SEMPO.

We strongly oppose the next wave of SEMPO or similar operations of the PNP and AFP in any part of the country that will possibly be a more brutal attack against the progressive groups, civilians and the people.

We call on the people of Guihulngan City, the whole of Negros Island and the whole country not to be overcome with fear and terror that the Duterte regime wants to perpetuate. It is just to fight for and defend human and democratic rights. The reign of a militarist, vulgar and tyrant Duterte and the consolidation of his power towards a dictatorship must be frustrated.

Condemn SEMPO/Oplan Sauron! Never Again to SEMPO!
 Justice for SEMPO victims! Resist Crackdown!

Stop the Killings! Fight Tyranny! Military out of the Countrysides! No to Martial Law!

Stand with Guihulngan! Makigbisog, dili mahadlok!
